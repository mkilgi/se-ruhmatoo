        <h1>Importance of investing</h1>
        <!-- allikas: https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1970?amount=1 -->
        <p1>Investing is a good way to protect your wealth against inflation. On average, money loses about <mark
                class="red"> 2-3%</mark> of it's
            value every year. For example 1$ in 1970 would be worth 7.68$
            today. Or alternatevly 1$ today will be worth about <mark class="red">5x less</mark> in 50 years. This is
            why it is important to
            start looking into investing.</p1>
        <h2>Fun facts</h2>
        <!-- allikas: https://financiallysimple.com/24-interesting-investing-statistics-you-must-know/ -->
        <p2>
            Did you know that if you invested <mark class="green">100$</mark> in an index fund like the S&P500 with an
            average intrest
            rate of 8%,
            then
            after 40 years you would have <mark class="green">2200$.</mark> The average investor, over a 20-year span
            ending in 2015, underperformed the S&P 500 by 6%. Over that period, the return was slightly less than
            inflation. If you do not start saving until 45, you will need to save three times as much as if you
            started at 25.
